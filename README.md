Hello retards (Amit Dor Itay),
after you git clone this repo, you need to:

1) run npm install (to install all the packages in the package.json file)
2) run this command: npm install nodemon
3) run this command: nodemon --exec ts-node src/app.ts 
4) verify that you see in the Terminal "Server is running on port 3000"
5) Enjoy retards
